# libMCell #

libMCell is the C library and the C API that enables other applications to use MCell capabilities and run MCell models.

libMCell is designed to directly support applications written in C, and to indirectly (via pyMCell) support applications written in python.

CellBlender is anticipated to use pyMCell to achieve its functionality.
