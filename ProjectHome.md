CellBlender is a Blender (http://blender.org) addon for creation, simulation, visualization, and analysis of realistic 3D Cell Models.  CellBlender leverages the full-featured 3D content creation capabilities of Blender to support a rich environment for the creation of simulation-ready, biophysically realistic models of the microscopic structure and biochemical function of cells.

CellBlender is fully functional with MCell (http://mcell.org) and partially functional with SBML (http://sbml.org).  We invite the computational cell biology community to contribute to the project, adding features and support for their favorite simulation environments.

CellBlender is developed with support from the National Center for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Systems ([MMBioS](http://www.mmbios.org)) funded by NIGMS at NIH under grant P41GM103712.
