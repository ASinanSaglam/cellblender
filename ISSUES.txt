This file is intended to be a running list of open and resolved issues for CellBlender.

Some of this functionality is in the various "issue trackers" that come with a particular
repository host (Google Code, GitHub, GitLab), but those "issue trackers" may be specific
to each platform and are not part of what's downloaded when a repository is cloned.

=== Open Issues ===

 1 Better user interface for the text output overlay

 2 Opening a parameter-driven swept geometry blend file doesn't display the right geometry.

 3 Can't use a parameter value for time step with MCellR
      (it may need to be converted to a numeric value for use with export or BNGL suite?)

 4 When sweeping (MCellR only?), the task list doesn't update until the last few are run.

 5 The plot setting to always generate all files seems to be stuck on (MCellR only?).

 6 Adding new release sites sometimes duplicates the default name (Release_Site_2 for example).

 7 It would be nice to not have to define reflective surface classes for everything (MCellR).

 8 Creating an MCellR project from scratch and running works, but sometimes the .blend file
     needs to be re-opened to show the mol-viz data. This seems to happen when deleting all
     CellBlender data and regenerating the project from a script. When a new project is
     created (with File/New) that doesn't seem to happen. It might have something to do
     with the proxy molecules? The errors are:

 9 Do we need reactions and observables to run MCellR?

 10 Testing ... we need lots of test cases to test various combinations of features.
    This is especially important for testing lots of features with MCellR.


=== Resolved Issues ===

 - In the Objects panel: selecting "Display From: Exported Files" doesn't work.
     This option doesn't make sense for static scripted objects.
     The logic was re-worked to produce sensible options for this case.

 - Display engine output (text) to the 3D view during run.
     Completed

 - Move the "start_time.txt" file into the <project>_files directory.
     start_time.txt is now in the <project>_files directory.

 - Doesn't seem to support sweeping ...
     Completed

 - Can't seem to add plain (non-BNGL) molecules to an MCellR simulation.
     This was an "operator error". Released molecules use a syntax like: @CP::x()
     They work fine without any components, but do need to be referenced properly.

 - Check for mcell path in extensions folder and use as the default if not already set
      (it should default to the extensions folder: extensions/mcell)
 - Check for bionetgen path in extensions folder and use as the default if not already set
      (it should default to the extensions folder: extensions/bng2/BNGL2.pl)

 - Add MCellR support to the "MCell Local" Engine/Runner.
     This is partially implemented, and being tested.
     Should we default to hiding the "mol_surface_proxy" and "mol_volume_proxy" molecules?
     Sometimes a model needs to be run twice for MCell to run (race condition in files?).
