# CellBlender #

CellBlender is a Blender addon for creation, simulation, visualization, and analysis of realistic 3D Cell Models. CellBlender leverages the full-featured 3D content creation capabilities of Blender to support a rich environment for the creation of simulation-ready, biophysically realistic models of the microscopic structure and biochemical function of cells.

CellBlender is fully functional with MCell (http://mcell.org) and partially functional with SBML (http://sbml.org). We invite the computational cell biology community to contribute to the project, adding features and support for their favorite simulation environments.

CellBlender development is supported by the NIGMS-funded (P41GM103712) National Center for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Systems [(MMBioS)](http://mmbios.org). Please acknowledge CellBlender in your publications.
