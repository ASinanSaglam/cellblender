This file is intended to be a running list of open and resolved issues for CellBlender.

Some of this functionality is in the various "issue trackers" that come with a particular
repository host (Google Code, GitHub, GitLab), but those "issue trackers" may be specific
to each platform and are not part of what's downloaded when a repository is cloned.

=== Open Issues ===

 - Add MCellR support to the "MCell Local" Engine/Runner.
 - Opening a parameter-driven swept geometry blend file doesn't display the right geometry.

=== Resolved Issues ===

 - In the Objects panel: selecting "Display From: Exported Files" doesn't work.
     This option doesn't make sense for static scripted objects.
     The logic was re-worked to produce sensible options for this case.
 - Display engine output (text) to the 3D view during run.
 - Move the "start_time.txt" file into the <project>_files directory.
